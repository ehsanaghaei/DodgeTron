I have multiple results, yet not finalized. The fact is that, working with large vectors and language model is super slow so each experiment takes significant amount of time. Also, I need to compare the results coming from different approaches. Currently, I am making "the max number of efficient clusters" for each famility to figure out what would be tI have multiple results, yet not finalized.
